      <h4>What is CORS?</h4>
      <p>
        <small>
          CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It is a security
          mechanism implemented in web browsers that allows resources (such as
          fonts, JavaScript, or AJAX requests) on a web page to be requested
          from a different domain than the one serving the page. CORS is used to
          enforce the browser's same-origin policy and prevent cross-origin
          attacks. It ensures that only trusted domains can access the resources
          of a web page, protecting users from potential security
          vulnerabilities.

        Why are you using Firebase? What other options do you have to implement
        authentication?
      </h4>

        <small>
          Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform provided by Google,
          which offers various services and features for building web and mobile
          applications. One of the reasons for using Firebase is its ease of use
          and quick setup for authentication. Firebase provides a pre-built
          authentication system that includes support for popular authentication
          methods like email/password, social login (Google, Facebook, etc.),
          and more.However, there are other options available for implementing
          authentication in web applications. Some popular alternatives to
          Firebase for authentication include: Auth0: Auth0 is a flexible and
          feature-rich authentication platform that provides secure
          authentication and authorization solutions. It offers various
          authentication methods, customizable login screens, and integrations
          with multiple identity providers. Okta: Okta is an identity and access
          management platform that provides robust authentication and
          authorization capabilities. It supports various authentication
          methods, multi-factor authentication, social login, and user
          management features. AWS Cognito: AWS Cognito is a fully managed user
          identity and authentication service provided by Amazon Web Services
          (AWS). It allows you to add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control
          to your web and mobile apps quickly. These are just a few examples,
          and there are many other authentication solutions available depending
          on your specific needs and preferences.

      <h4>How does the private route work?</h4>
      <p><small>In a web application, a private route is a route that requires authentication before allowing access to a specific page or component. It ensures that only authenticated users can view the protected content.

The implementation of private routes may vary depending on the framework or library you are using. In React, you can create a private route by using a combination of route configuration and authentication checks.

Here's a simplified example of how a private route could work in a React application:

Define a PrivateRoute component that wraps the regular Route component provided by the React Router library.
Inside the PrivateRoute component, check if the user is authenticated. If the user is authenticated, render the component passed to the PrivateRoute.
If the user is not authenticated, redirect them to a login page or display an appropriate message.</small></p>
